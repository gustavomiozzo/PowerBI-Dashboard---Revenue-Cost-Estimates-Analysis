# PowerBI-Dashboard---Revenue-Cost-Estimates-Analysis
This is a dynamic dashboard that I developed for a client of the accounting firm where I work, offering comprehensive insights into their financial landscape. It delivers essential data on revenue, costs, and fulfills various client requirements. Notable features include comparisons between estimated and actual values, identifying significant variances, detailed cost analysis by categories, and in-depth labor hour analysis. Plus, it includes other functions to give a complete view of the business's performance.

To create this dynamic dashboard, an extensive process was undertaken. It involved aggregating data from multiple databases, including QuickBooks Online (QBO), the company's SQL database, and payroll information. Subsequently, meticulous data cleansing procedures were conducted using Excel and Python. This phase encompassed tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Following data preparation, a series of complex calculations and data manipulations were performed. This included conducting various financial analyses, comparing estimated figures with actual values, identifying and analyzing significant variances, and categorizing costs into distinct categories such as Direct Cost, Overhead, Materials, Equipment, Subcontractors, and Others.

Additionally, the PowerBI dashboard was divided into 4 tabs for enhanced organization and clarity: Summary, Revenue, Cost, and Hours. This segmentation was designed to facilitate easy visualization and streamlined access to specific data insights. Moreover, the dashboard was crafted with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive navigation, ensuring that stakeholders could easily explore and interpret the data. I paid close attention to the design, making sure different sets of data fit together smoothly. This involved creating models that could handle various types of information and update in real-time, making the dashboard easier to use and more effective overall.

Throughout the development process, a focus on attention to detail ensured the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by the dashboard. The end result is a powerful tool that empowers stakeholders with actionable data, facilitating informed decision-making and offering a comprehensive view of the business's performance.
