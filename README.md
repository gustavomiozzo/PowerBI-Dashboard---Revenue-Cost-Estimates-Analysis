# PowerBI-Dashboard---Revenue-Cost-Estimates-Analysis
This is a dynamic dashboard that I developed for a client of the accounting firm where I work, offering comprehensive insights into their financial landscape. It delivers essential data on revenue, costs, and fulfills various client requirements. Notable features include comparisons between estimated and actual values, identifying significant variances, detailed cost analysis categorized by company categories (such as Direct Cost, Overhead, Materials, Equipment, Subcontractors and Others), and in-depth labor hour analysis. Additionally, it  a range of other functionalities to provide a complete view of the business's performance.

To create this dynamic dashboard, an extensive process was undertaken. It involved aggregating data from multiple databases, including QuickBooks Online (QBO), the company's SQL database, and payroll information. Subsequently, meticulous data cleansing procedures were conducted using Excel and Python. This phase encompassed tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Following data preparation, a series of complex calculations and data manipulations were performed. This included conducting various financial analyses, comparing estimated figures with actual values, identifying and analyzing significant variances, and categorizing costs into distinct categories such as Direct Cost, Overhead, Materials, Equipment, Subcontractors, and Others.

Additionally, the PowerBI dashboard was divided into 4 tabs for enhanced organization and clarity: Summary, Revenue, Cost, and Hours. This segmentation was designed to facilitate easy visualization and streamlined access to specific data insights. Moreover, the dashboard was crafted with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive navigation, ensuring that stakeholders could easily explore and interpret the data. Furthermore, extensive attention was given to intricate modeling, enabling seamless integration of disparate datasets. It involved designing data models capable of efficiently handling diverse sources of information and facilitating real-time updates, enhancing the overall usability and effectiveness of the dashboard.

Throughout the development process, a focus on attention to detail ensured the accuracy and reliability of the information provided by the dashboard. The end result is a powerful tool that empowers stakeholders with actionable data, facilitating informed decision-making and offering a comprehensive view of the business's performance.
