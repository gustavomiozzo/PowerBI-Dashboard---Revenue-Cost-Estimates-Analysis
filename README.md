# PowerBI-Dashboard---Revenue-Cost-Estimates-Analysis
This is a dashboard that I built for a client. It provides basic information such as revenue and costs, as well as addressing some client needs, including comparisons between estimates and actual values, identification of worst variances, cost analysis broken down by company divisions, and labor hour analysis.
